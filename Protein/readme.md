# Protein 3D Printing

Download PDF file for more info (CAT, SPA, ENG).

Example uses BCR-ABL wt (2HYY) and mutant (2Z60) with some ATP, imatinib and dasatinib as ligands.

## Protocol
1. Look for your ptein of interest at the Protein Data Bank and downalod PDB file.
2. Open PDB file with PyMol.
3. Export from PDB to STL.
4. Load STL into Netfabb
5. Fix file.
6. Modifiy surface
7 Cut into 2 bodies.
8. Export each body into separate STL file. 
9. Print each file 20% infill, with suports and/or rafts.
